## My Family

I have a wife and two children who live with me in Dhaka:

- **Wife:** Mrs. Rashida Begum (42 years old)
  - She is a housewife and depends on me for money
  - We have been married for 21 years

- **Son:** Mohammad Rifat Osman (18 years old)  
  - He is studying for HSC exam
  - He needs me to pay for his education
  - He wants to go to university in Bangladesh

- **Daughter:** Fatima Osman (15 years old)
  - She is in SSC class
  - She needs me to take care of her
  - She is too young to be alone

- **Parents:** My elderly father and mother
  - Father is 72 years old and sick
  - Mother is 68 years old with health problems
  - They need me to pay for their medicine
  - I spend BDT 25,000 every month on their medical care

## My Business

I have my own import/export business:
- **Business name:** Osman Trading International
- **Started:** 2015 (11 years ago)
- **Employees:** 8 people work for me
- **Income:** BDT 120,000 - 150,000 per month

My business needs me because:
- I have to meet with suppliers and customers
- I have contracts to complete in April and May 2026
- My employees depend on me for their salaries
- I have to renew my trade license every year

## My Property

I own valuable property in Bangladesh:
- **Main house:** 5-story building worth BDT 32,000,000
- **Location:** Bashundhara Residential Area, Dhaka
- **Income:** I get BDT 215,000 rent every month
- **Other property:** Commercial plot worth BDT 8,000,000

I cannot sell this property quickly. It gives me rental income that my family needs.

## My Community

I am active in my local community:
- I am a member of Bashundhara Residential Area committee
- I go to community meetings every month
- I donate to my local mosque regularly
- I help organize religious festivals

## Why I Will Return

I must come back to Bangladesh because:

1. **Family needs me:**
   - My wife cannot work and needs my support
   - My children need me for their education
   - My parents are old and sick

2. **Business obligations:**
   - I have big contracts to finish in 2026
   - 8 employees depend on me for jobs
   - I have to pay rent for my office

3. **Financial responsibilities:**
   - I pay BDT 305,000 every month for family and business
   - I have to file tax returns
   - I collect rent from my properties

4. **Legal duties:**
   - I am my daughter's legal guardian (she is only 15)
   - I own property that needs my signature for any changes
   - I have to renew business licenses

## Future Plans in Bangladesh

After I return from Iceland, I have important things to do:
- Help my son apply for university (April-June 2026)
- Complete business contracts worth BDT 20,00,000
- Attend my cousin's wedding in June 2026
- File annual tax returns and renew business license

## My Promise

I promise that:
- I will only stay in Iceland for 14 days
- I will come back to Bangladesh before my visa ends
- I will not try to work in Iceland
- I will not try to bring my family to live in Iceland
- I will follow all Iceland laws

My life is in Bangladesh. My family, business, and property are all here. This trip to Iceland is just for vacation. I will definitely return home.
